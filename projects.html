      <h2 class="rollerball__container">Rollerball Project</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="rollerball__text">​My first Project, I had created a Rollerball game where the player had to collect all of the collectibles and get to the end without dying this project was created with Unity and Maya 3D. My main concept was that my game would consist of one massive road with slopes as well as sharp corners to make it harder for the player. I had also added a timer to make it more challenging and fun so that if they don't get to the finish line with all the collectibles they will die.</p>
      <h2 class="infinite_runner__container">Infinite Runner Project</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="infinite_runner__text">My second Project was called Reaper Dash and it was an infinite runner which was created on Unity and Aseprite, a 2D pixel art tool. The aim is that the player should run and avoid any obstacles that is in the way. The player can also collect coins which will increase their score as well as the time survived in a game. My main concept for this project was to make it dark and as well as vibrant so that the game is engaging, and I wanted to link my obstacle to the theme that I had chosen.</p>
      <h2 class="horror_vr__container">Horror VR Project</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="horror_vr__text">My third project was a Horror VR, and this project was created using Unreal Engine and Maya 3D. The main aim for this project was that I wanted to create an immersive experience for the player whilst they are in Virtual Reality. I had created many spooky effects to go with this game to make it fit the genre.</p>

      <h2 class="random_level__container">Random Level Generation Project</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="random_level__text">This was my first project of my specialism which is Games Programming, and I had decided to a Random Level Generation. I had used Tile Mapping and Rules to create this and the aim is for the player to explore and random generate new maps based on the width and height that I have set. This whole Task was created using Aesprite and Unity.</p>

      <h2 class="stealth_ai__container">Stealth AI Project</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="stealth_ai__text">This was my second project for my specialism which is a stealth AI project and this has been created on Unity. I had used NavMesh so that the AI can use pathfinding to go to waypoints without being controlled. The aim of this game is to get to the goal without being detected. The AI's use a cone targeting radius to detect the player and if the player goes inside of their targeting radius they get destroyed and lose. The player is also timed where if the player doesn't get to the end they also get destroyed. This was made by using Unity</p>
