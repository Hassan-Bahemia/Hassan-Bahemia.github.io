        â€‹My first Project, I had created a Rollerball game where the player had
        to collect all of the collectibles and get to the end without dying this
        project was created with Unity and Maya 3D. My main concept was that my
        game would consist of one massive road with slopes as well as sharp
        corners to make it harder for the player. I had also added a timer to
        make it more challenging and fun so that if they don't get to the finish
        line with all the collectibles they will die

        that the player should run and avoid any obstacles that is in the way.
        The player can also collect coins which will increase their score as
        well as the time survived in a game. My main concept for this project
        was to make it dark and as well as vibrant so that the game is engaging,
        and I wanted to link my obstacle to the theme that I had chosen

        in Virtual Reality. I had created many spooky effects to go with this

        random generate new maps based on the width and height that I have set.

        the AI can use pathfinding to go to waypoints without being controlled.
        The aim of this game is to get to the goal without being detected. The
        AI's use a cone targeting radius to detect the player and if the player
        goes inside of their targeting radius they get destroyed and lose. The
        player is also timed where if the player doesn't get to the end they
        also get destroyed. This was made by using Unity

        are able to join and host games of their own and player a game of Free
        for all where they must kill each other. The player has a scoreboard
        with their kills and deaths. There is also a stats section when the

        asteroid shooter which spawns in multiple asteroids based on the spawn
        frequency rate and the player has to destroy a certain amount of
        asteroids to beat the game. If they get hit by one then they lose a life
        until they have reached 0 lives and lose the game. The aim was to learn
        about how ECS works and how much resources can be saved and increasing
        frames whilst using data orientated programming

        to create a beautifully lit scene that has certain objects animated to
        showcase the environemnt and highlighting the specific post processing
        effects that were used. These included shadows, reflections, refractions

        created a 3D survial rogue like adventure game where the player must use
        their tools to harverst resources to build a boat and escape. They also
        have tools to kill enemies that spawn frequently and will attempt to
        stop the player from completing their objective. Once the player has all
        the resources then they must kill the final boss and build the boat so
        that they can escape. This was created using Unity and the entire game
        is a fully procedural game which includes the terrain being generated
        and resources spawning in.

        dead stars, asteroid belts and dead planets which attempt to destroy the

        Treasure Thieves is a team based PVP online multiplayer game where the
        players must steal the treasures from the enemies teams base and bring
        it back to their own base. In order to steal the treasure effectively,
        the player will need to protect the person who is holding the treasure
        by fighting off enemies or the holder of the treasure can just pass it
        around to other teammates which is risky since the enemy can come and
        intercept the pass. I was the programmer and I was tasked with creating
        the online functionality of the game since it was going to be a
        multiplayer game. I also created a pickup and throwing the treasure
        mechanic so that the players can pass around if they are being attack by
        other players. I also implemented a score system so that whichever team
        scores the amount required the game would end. I also created the level
        and made sure that everything was adjusted to the player scale and there
        was no bugs within the level. This was a good project since it was
        another multiplayer project that I had worked on using Unity but rather
        than using Unity UNet, we had used Photon 2 to create a multiplayer game

        punch your opponents off the stage, beat them up until they have no
        health left or you can grab hold of them which slows them down. Also to
        get to the finish line there will be a variety of obstacles. This was
        made using Unreal Engine and I was the programmer and my role in game
        was creating the level and adding in local multiplayer splitscreen which
        each player being able to control their own player. I also added in many

        and I was the Gameplay Programmer for this game. I had created specific
        mechanics such as the player doing a combo system, rolling, activating
        ablities and spawning in the enemy AIs. I was also responsible with the
        level design and creating the different maps for the cinematic game. I
        really enjoyed this project because I got to learn how to implement
        cinematics in a games engine and how to make them work in a sequence and
        creating audio cues when needed. I also learnt how to create a camera
        shot and learn new possibilities with Unreal itself.
